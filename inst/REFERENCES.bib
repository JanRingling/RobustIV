	abstract = {This paper gives a relatively simple, well behaved solution to the problem of many instruments in heteroskedastic data. Such settings are common in microeconometric applications where many instruments are used to improve efficiency and allowance for heteroskedasticity is generally important. The solution is a Fuller (1977) like estimator and standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity and many instruments. We show that the estimator has finite moments and high asymptotic efficiency in a range of cases. The standard errors are easy to compute, being like White's (1982), with additional terms that account for many instruments. They are consistent under standard, many instrument, and many weak instrument asymptotics. We find that the estimator is asymptotically as efficient as the limited-information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator under many weak instruments. In Monte Carlo experiments, we find that the estimator performs as well as LIML or Fuller (1977) under homoskedasticity, and has much lower bias and dispersion under heteroskedasticity, in nearly all cases considered.},

	abstract = {We consider instrumental variables regression in models where the number of available instruments may be larger than the sample size and consistent model selection in the first stage may not be possible. Such a situation may arise when there are many weak instruments. With many weak instruments, existing approaches to first-stage regularization can lead to a large bias relative to standard errors. We propose a jackknife instrumental variables estimator (JIVE) with regularization at each jackknife iteration that helps alleviate this bias. We derive the limiting behavior for a ridge-regularized JIV estimator (RJIVE), verifying that the RJIVE is consistent and asymptotically normal under conditions which allow for more instruments than observations and do not require consistent model selection. We provide simulation results that demonstrate the proposed RJIVE performs favorably in terms of size of tests and risk properties relative to other many-weak instrument estimation strategies in high-dimensional settings. We also apply the RJIVE to the Angrist and Krueger (1991) example where it performs favorably relative to other many-instrument robust procedures.},

	abstract = {This paper considers tests of the parameter of an endogenous variable in an instrumental variables regression model. The focus is on one-sided conditional t-tests. Theoretical and numerical work shows that the conditional 2SLS and Fuller t-tests perform well even when instruments are weakly correlated with the endogenous variable. When the population F-statistic is as small as two, their power is reasonably close to the power envelopes for similar and non-similar tests which are invariant to rotation transformations of the instruments. This finding is surprising considering the bad performance of two-sided conditional t-tests found in Andrews et al. (2007). We show these tests have bad power because the conditional null distributions of t-statistics are asymmetric when instruments are weak. Taking this asymmetry into account, we propose two-sided tests based on t-statistics. These novel tests are approximately unbiased and can perform as well as the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test.},

	abstract = {Two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates are biased towards the probability limit of OLS estimates. This bias grows with the degree of over-identification and can generate highly misleading results. In this paper we propose two simple alternatives to 2SLS and limited-information-maximum-likelihood (LIML) estimators for models with more instruments than endogenous regressors. These estimators can be interpreted as instrumental variables procedures using an instrument that is independent of disturbances even in finite samples. Independence is achieved by using a 'leave-one-out' jackknife-type fitted value in place of the usual first stage equation. The new estimators are first order equivalent to 2SLS but with finite-sample properties superior, in terms of bias and coverage rate of confidence intervals, compared to those of 2SLS and similar to those of LIML, when there are many instruments.},

	abstract = {Properties of instrumental variable estimators are sensitive to the choice of valid instruments, even in large cross-section applications. In this paper we address this problem by deriving simple mean-square error criteria that can be minimized to choose the instrument set. We develop these criteria for two-stage least squares (2SLS), limited information maximum likelihood (LIML), and a bias adjusted version of 2SLS (B2SLS). We give a theoretical derivation of the mean-square error and show optimality. In Monte Carlo experiments we find that the instrument choice generally yields an improvement in performance. Also, in the Angrist and Krueger (1991) returns to education application, when the instrument set is chosen in the way we consider, it turns out that both 2SLS and LIML give similar (large) returns to education.},
